# Spooky Story Generator Functionality Â ðŸ‘»
Welcome to the Spooky Story Generator! This project is a creative experiment in integrating various technologies to bring stories to life through text, images, and audio. The app takes a user's input â€” either a story idea or an image â€” and uses AI to generate a whimsical, spooky short story, which is then converted into audio and stored in AWS S3 for playback.

### What I Learned
This project was a deep dive into working with:

- **[OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)** for generating stories from both text prompts and images.
- **[Text-to-Speech Conversion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio)** to bring the story to life in audio format.
- **[AWS S3 Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-node-examples.html)** for storing audio files securely and accessing them through public URLs.
- **[Next.js Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations)** and **[API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)** to handle secure server-side processes, such as API calls and file uploads.

Through building this, I gained experience in managing server-client interactions, handling media files, and creating a cohesive user experience for generating and sharing unique audio stories.
